# Peierls-Nabarro-model
Computes the distance between partial dislocations and the Peierls-Nabarro stress to move partial dislocations in face-centred cubic materials. 
Requires as input:
- Lattice parameter, elastic moduli
- Points on the GSFE surface
Input parameters are provided for two derivatives of the Cantor (Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni) high entropy alloy.
